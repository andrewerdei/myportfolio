            <h2>Course Scheduler</h2>
            <h4>VueJS, Python, Html, CSS, Javascript, AWS, Git, Trello</h4>
            <p> This project was created as a final project for CSE 2102: Intro to Software Engineering. Working in a group of four, we
                created a website that allows students of an institution to add/drop courses onto their schedule and see what courses are offered,
                what prerequisites they have, as well as the times and professor of each course. On top of the student view of the site, there is also 
                an admin login where professors and other administrators declared in the AWS DynamoDB table can access their courses and edit/remove them.
                The frontend of this website was created using VueJS and planned using Trello while the backend was created using Python and utilizing AWS 
                features such as Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, and API Gateway. The collaboration was kept track of and carried out through the use of Git.
